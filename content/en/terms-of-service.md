# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "this site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using this site, you're essentially saying "I agree!" to these terms.

## 1. What We Offer
What we offer? Well, **this site** is your go-to for paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even cool community interactions! Some of the juiciest bits are just for our subscribers, though.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
Okay, about **your account** and getting signed up:
- **Users** need to provide a valid email and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy! ✨
- **You**, the user, are responsible for keeping your account secure and for all the activity happening on it. **No sharing or transferring** your account, capiche? 🚫
- **This site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
Let's talk about **paid subscription services**:
- **These services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💰
- **All payments** are handled securely via third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Don't worry, **we** don't store any of your payment info. Your financial deets are safe. 🛡️
- Your **subscription** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Heads up! 🔄
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (find it at the end of these terms) and let us know why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this. If it's been more than 14 days or you're not a first-timer, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair's fair, right? 😉

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
Time to chat about **content use and intellectual property**:
- **All original content** on this site is **copyrighted by hubtoday**. So, hands off! 🙅‍♀️ You can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission.
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Think of it as a library card, not ownership! 📚
- If you're looking to use our content for commercial stuff or quote us extensively, you gotta reach out and get authorization from **this site** first. Easy peasy.

## 5. User Conduct Rules
Let's lay down some **user conduct rules** – basically, how not to be a jerk: 😉
- **You** are **not allowed** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Keep it clean, folks! 😇
- Also, **don't** try to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content using technical tricks. That's a big no-no. ⛔
- **This site** has the right to yank any inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
Alright, **service changes and interruptions** – life happens, right?
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or totally stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just so you know. 🤷‍♀️
- If, say, an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service outage means you can't access content temporarily, **this site** won't be on the hook for any compensation. Bummer, but true. 😔

## 7. Disclaimer
A quick **disclaimer** from us:
- **The info on this site** is just for kicks and giggles (okay, mostly for reference!). It's **not** meant to be professional advice of any kind – think financial, legal, medical, etc. Always get a pro opinion, got it? 🧑‍⚖️👩‍⚕️
- **This site** takes **no responsibility** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real. 😬

## 8. Governing Law
Let's talk about **governing law**:
- **These Terms of Service** are subject to and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law rules! 🇺🇸
- If **any disputes** pop up relating to or arising from these terms, we both agree to try and sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Hope it doesn't come to that, though! 🙏
